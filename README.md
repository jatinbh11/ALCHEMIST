# ALCHEMIST -  Disease Prediction Web Application ðŸŒŸ


This project is a **Machine Learning (ML)-powered web application** designed to predict the likelihood of diseases such as **diabetes,  heart disease, and kidney disease**. Built with **Streamlit**, the app provides an interactive, user-friendly interface where users can input health-related information and receive predictions in real-time.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Early Disease Detection**: Helps in identifying risks of major diseases early, supporting timely medical intervention.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes trained ML models for accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use application built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Scalability**: Designed to include more diseases in the future.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for training and deploying models.
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit for building the web application.
- **Languages**: Python for all development tasks.
